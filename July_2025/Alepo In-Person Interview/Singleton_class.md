# My Understanding On SingleTon Class 

A **singleton class** is a class that allows only **one instance** of itself to be created. 
It ensures that there is a **single, globally accessible object** of that class throughout the program.

**üîπ Singleton Class Definition (Conceptually):**

> A singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.



**üîπ Key Characteristics:**

- Only **one instance** exists.
- Provides a **global access point** to that instance.
- Useful in cases like **configuration classes**, **logging**, **database connections**, etc.


Singleton class is a class which has only one Object. 
Means we can create only one instance throughout the execution of program. 
We can not create multiple object of this class. 
To restrict to create multiple objects we create private constructor in it. 
So no one can create its object from out side the class. 
And we provide already created object which is a **single, globally accessible object** of that class throughout the program.

```java
public class SingletonClass {

    private static SingletonClass instance;

    private singletonClass() {

    }

    public static SingletonClass getInstance () {
  
      if(instance == null)
      {
          instance = new SingletonClass();
      }
      return instance;  
    }
}

class Main { 
  public static void main(String [] args) {

      SingletonClass s = SingletonClass.getInstance();
      
  }
}
```

üìå Summary of Your Notes (Improved):

- A **Singleton class** ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application lifecycle. This is achieved by:
- Making the constructor **private** to prevent outside instantiation.
- Storing the instance in a **private static field**.
- Providing a **public static method** to return the instance (and create it if it doesn‚Äôt exist).
- (Optional) Making the access thread-safe using synchronization or enums.

# Review of My class 

 ‚úÖ **What you got right:**

- Singleton ensures only **one object** of the class exists.
- Use of a **private constructor** to prevent external instantiation.
- Use of a **static method** (`getInstance()`) to return the single instance.
- Lazy initialization ‚Äî the instance is created when needed. 


‚ö†Ô∏è **Improvements / Corrections Needed:**


1. **Thread Safety**

Your implementation is **not thread-safe**. In a multithreaded environment, two threads could simultaneously enter `getInstance()` and create multiple instances.

You can make it thread-safe in several ways:

a. **Synchronized Method** (simplest fix, but slower)

```java
public static synchronized SingletonClass getInstance() {

    if(instance == null) {
        instance = new SingletonClass();
    }

    return instance;
}
```

b. **Double-Checked Locking** (better performance) - use volatile keyword when declaring instance AND use synchronized (SingletonClass.class) { block 
to check instance and create instace }

```java
public class SingletonClass {
    private static volatile SingletonClass instance;
    
    private SingletonClass() {}

    public static SingletonClass getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (SingletonClass.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new SingletonClass();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

c. **Eager Initialization**

If you don‚Äôt care about lazy loading: then you can create directoly instance. 
Create Instance as static final and initialize it at that time only because it is final so it should be initialize at that 
time only. 
- If you go with this then it is by default thread safe, coz if 2 thread access then they will get same object.

```java
public class SingletonClass {

    private static final SingletonClass instance = new SingletonClass();

    private SingletonClass() {}

    public static SingletonClass getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```



 ‚úÖ **What You Can Add for Better Understanding:**

* **Use Cases**: Useful for logging, caching, configuration, database connections.
* **Drawbacks**: Harder to unit test (tight coupling), may become a bottleneck.
* **Enum Singleton** (Best practice in modern Java):

```java
public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;

    public void doSomething() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```

# My Doubts :

‚úÖ 1. **Can I make this variable `final`?**
‚úÖ 2. **What does `synchronized` do?**
‚úÖ 3. **What is Lazy vs. Eager Initialization?**
‚úÖ 4. **Real-world Use Cases (Other than DB Connections)**
‚úÖ 5. **Why Enum Singleton is Better?**


‚úÖ 1. **Can I make this variable `final`?**

```java
private static volatile SingletonClass instance;
```

 ‚ùå No, you **can not** make this variable `final`, when lazy loading

‚ùì Why not?

- `final` means the variable **must be assigned once and only once** ‚Äî at the time of declaration or in a static block.
- In **lazy initialization**, you are creating the object *later* (i.e., when `getInstance()` is first called), not immediately when the class loads.
- So, this won't work:

  ```java
  private static final SingletonClass instance; // compiler error unless assigned
  ```
- If you want to make it `final`, you must use **eager initialization**

  ```java
  private static final SingletonClass instance = new SingletonClass();
  ```


 ‚úÖ 2. **What does `synchronized` do?**

 üîí **`synchronized`** is a **thread control keyword** in Java.

It prevents **multiple threads** from executing a block of code **at the same time**, which helps **avoid race conditions**.

**üëâ In Singleton:** 
- you can use it with method getInstance() 

```java
public static synchronized SingletonClass getInstance() {
    if(instance == null) {
        instance = new SingletonClass();
    }
    return instance;
}
```

- Here, **only one thread at a time** can enter this method. If two threads try to access it, one waits until the other finishes.
- This ensures only **one instance** is created.

**üß† In Double-Checked Locking:** 
- in double checking lock you can create synchronized (SingletonClass.class){ block and add check and create part in it }

```java
if (instance == null) {
    synchronized (SingletonClass.class) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SingletonClass();
        }
    }
}
```

- This is more efficient: synchronization is used **only once** (when instance is null).
- After that, it doesn‚Äôt enter the `synchronized` block at all.


‚úÖ 3. **What is Lazy vs. Eager Initialization?**

 üîµ **Lazy Initialization**:

- Instance is created **only when needed** (on first call).
- Saves memory and resources if the object is never used.
- Example:

  ```java
  if (instance == null) {
      instance = new SingletonClass();
  }
  ```

 üî¥ **Eager Initialization**:

- Instance is created **when class is loaded**, even if it‚Äôs never used.
- Safer in multi-threaded environments.
- Example:

  ```java
  private static final SingletonClass instance = new SingletonClass();
  ```

|                | Lazy                   | Eager                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| When created   | On first use           | When class is loaded   |
| Resource usage | Efficient              | May waste memory       |
| Thread safety  | Needs special handling | Thread-safe by default |


 ‚úÖ 4. **Real-world Use Cases (Other than DB Connections)**

üîß **Configuration Manager**

* A singleton that holds app-level settings like environment variables, paths, limits.
* Example: `AppConfig.getInstance().getMaxUploadSize();`

 üßæ **Logger**

* You don‚Äôt want multiple logger instances writing to the same file.
* Example: `Logger.getInstance().log("User logged in");`

 üì¶ **Cache**

* A singleton holds frequently accessed data in memory.
* Example: `CacheManager.getInstance().get("user_123");`

üåê **Network Manager**

* Manages HTTP client sessions, API headers.
* Example: `NetworkManager.getInstance().sendRequest();`

 üì∏ **Analytics Tracker**

* One global tracker used across all screens/modules.



 ‚úÖ 5. **Why Enum Singleton is Better?**

 üîê Enum Singleton is:

* **Thread-safe**
* **Serialization-safe** (important if you're saving state)
* **Reflection-safe** (you can't break it with reflection easily)

**üëá Example:**

```java
public enum Logger {
    INSTANCE;

    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Log: " + message);
    }
}
```

### üí° Real-Life Example:

Imagine a **Printer Spooler** system:

* Only one instance should manage all print jobs to avoid conflict.

With Enum:

```java
public enum PrinterSpooler {
    INSTANCE;

    public void addJob(String job) {
        System.out.println("Adding job: " + job);
    }
}
```

Even if someone tries to clone, serialize, or use reflection ‚Äî the **Enum** is protected by Java at the language level.



üìå Summary:

| Feature            | Classic Singleton | Enum Singleton  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Thread-safe        | Only with effort  | Yes, by default |
| Serialization-safe | Needs extra code  | Yes             |
| Reflection-safe    | Can be broken     | Yes             |
| Simplicity         | More complex      | Very simple     |
