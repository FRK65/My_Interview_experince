1. **Marker Interface**:



### What is a Marker Interface?

A **Marker Interface** is an interface that **does not contain any methods or fields** — it’s completely empty. Its sole purpose is to **mark** or **tag** a class so that the Java runtime or some framework can recognize that class has a particular property or should be treated in a specific way.



### Why use Marker Interfaces?

* To provide **metadata** to the JVM or frameworks about a class.
* To enable certain behaviors without adding methods.
* Acts as a **tag** or **flag** to signal capabilities.



### Examples of Marker Interfaces in Java:

* **`Serializable`** — marks a class whose objects can be serialized (converted to byte stream).
* **`Cloneable`** — marks a class whose objects can be cloned using `Object.clone()`.
* **`Remote`** — used in Java RMI to indicate remote objects.



### Example:

```java
public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int id;

    // getters, setters, constructors
}
```

Here, `Employee` class is **marked** as serializable. Even though `Serializable` has no methods, Java runtime knows to allow serialization on `Employee` objects.



### Summary:

| Marker Interface                 | Purpose                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| No methods or fields             | Used just to mark/tag a class |
| Example: Serializable, Cloneable | Indicate special behavior     |

# 2. Want a quick comparison with Functional Interface next? 
Yes 


Here’s a quick comparison between **Functional Interface** and **Marker Interface**, plus a real-life example of a marker interface:



### Functional Interface vs Marker Interface

| Feature             | Functional Interface                                                    | Marker Interface                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Methods**         | Exactly **one abstract method** (can have default/static methods)       | **No methods** at all (empty interface)          |
| **Purpose**         | To enable **functional programming** and lambdas                        | To **tag or mark** classes for special treatment |
| **Java 8+ feature** | Yes                                                                     | No (existed before Java 8)                       |
| **Annotation**      | Can be annotated with `@FunctionalInterface` (optional but recommended) | No annotation needed                             |
| **Usage Example**   | `Runnable`, `Comparator`                                                | `Serializable`, `Cloneable`                      |



### Real-Life Example of Marker Interface: `Serializable`

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class User implements Serializable {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

**Explanation:**

* The `User` class is marked `Serializable`.
* `Serializable` interface has **no methods** but marks the class so that Java’s serialization mechanism knows it can safely serialize objects of `User`.
* If you try to serialize a class that doesn’t implement `Serializable`, you get a `NotSerializableException`.
