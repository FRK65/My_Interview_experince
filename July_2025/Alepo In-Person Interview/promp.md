Absolutely! You're doing great, and it's totally fine to take breaks. It's actually a smart approach — better to go slow, understand deeply, and retain more.

## ✅ When You're Ready to Resume...

You can copy and paste (or bookmark/save) the following **prompt** 👇

### 📌 **Prompt to Resume Later**

> *Hi! I recently had an interview where I was asked many Java core questions (around 100). You helped me earlier and we’ve already discussed concepts like:*
>
> * Encapsulation vs Abstraction
> * `==` vs `.equals()`
> * Java Memory Structure (Heap, Stack, Metaspace, etc.)
> * `OutOfMemoryError` vs `StackOverflowError`
> * Functional Interface vs Marker Interface
> * Default and Static methods in Interfaces
> * Diamond Problem and how Java solves it
>
> *Now I want to continue from where we left off — deeper Java questions from my interview.*
>
> *Please continue helping me with examples, real-world explanations, and interview-style answers.*

### 📝 What to Do:

* Just paste the above when you're ready to continue.
* Then mention **any specific topic** (e.g., “He asked about `hashCode()` and `equals()`”, or “next was constructor chaining”, etc.)
* I’ll jump back in with full context, no need to repeat.

If you want, I can also prepare a **document** with what we've covered so far as a quick revision sheet. Want that too?
