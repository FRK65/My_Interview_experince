**1. This is a classic Java interview trap where they go deeper than just the == vs .equals() explanation.**


First understand : **is hashCode return memory address in java ?** 
> Yes, in Java, the default implementation of the hashCode() method (inherited from the Object class) returns an integer value that is often derived from the memory address of the object, but it's not exactly the memory address itself.

You already explained the **right behavior**:

* `==` compares **object references** (memory addresses)
* `.equals()` compares **object contents** (as defined by the class)

But the interviewer wanted to know:

> ‚ùì **How does `.equals()` actually work internally? Why does it give `true` for `str1.equals(str2)` even when `str1 doesn't equals str2`?**



**‚úÖ Quick Summary**

```java
String str1 = new String("java");
String str2 = new String("java");

System.out.println(str1 == str2);         // false
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2));    // true
```

* `==` ‚Üí false because `str1` and `str2` are **two different objects**
* `.equals()` ‚Üí Giving true because `String` overrides `.equals()` to compare **character sequences**, not references

---

### üîç Internal Implementation of `equals()` in `String` Class

Here‚Äôs how `String.equals()` works internally in Java (simplified):

```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this.currentObj == obj)
            return true;                       // Same reference ‚Üí return true

    if (obj instanceof String other) {                  // Check type 
        if (this.length() != other.length()) return false;
        for (int i = 0; i < this.length(); i++) {
            if (this.charAt(i) != other.charAt(i)) {
                return false;                           // Compare character by character
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    return false;                                       // Not a String ‚Üí false
}
```
Line by Line explanation of above code where we cover equals method in String : 
1.  `String` overrides `.equals()` to compare **character sequences**, not references.
2.  In Code first we check if reference are equals then return true yahi se.
3.  If not then passed Object type, means obj is instanceof String or not if yes then check...
4.  check... length of both object(String) if length not match return false else check ...
5.  each character by str1.charAt(i)==str2.charAt(i) or not if any char failse return false if all ok then return true.
6.  if upper check fails or didn't return anything yet then return false.



**üß† Key Points to Explain in an Interview:**

- "When we call `str1.equals(str2)`, the `String` class‚Äôs overridden `equals()` method is used.
- It first checks if **both objects are the same reference (`this == obj`).**
- If not, **it checks whether the object is an instance of `String`.**
- **Then it compares their lengths**, and
- finally does a **character-by-character comparison**.
- If all characters match, it returns true."*



**üîÅ What if You Were Comparing Custom Objects Not String ?**

If you don‚Äôt override `.equals()`, the default in `Object` is:

```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    return this == obj;
}
```

So:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
}

Person p1 = new Person("John", 25);
Person p2 = new Person("John", 25);

p1.equals(p2); // false ‚Äî unless we override equals()
```

‚úÖ To fix this:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj instanceof Person other) {
        return this.name.equals(other.name) && this.age == other.age; // Put check on all instance variable
    }
    return false;
}
```



**üó£ How to Say This in an Interview:**

- *‚ÄúIn my example, `str1` and `str2` point to different objects, so `==` is false.
- But `String` overrides `.equals()` to compare the actual characters inside the strings.
- Internally, it checks reference equality first,
- then length, and then character-by-character comparison.
- That‚Äôs why `str1.equals(str2)` is true‚Äîeven though the references are different.‚Äù


--------


Ah, I see the confusion! Let's break it down carefully.

### ü§î Key Point About **References**:

When we say **‚Äúreferences are the same‚Äù**, we‚Äôre talking about whether **two variables point to the same memory location** (i.e., the same object in memory).

### Let's look at your scenario:

```java
String abc = new String("abc");
String xyz = new String("xyz");

System.out.println(abc.equals(xyz));  // This should return false
```

### Why does this return **false** and not **true**?

The reason **`abc.equals(xyz)`** returns **false** is because **`.equals()` checks the content of the strings**, and **`"abc"` is not the same as `"xyz"`**.

* **`abc`** contains **`"abc"`**.
* **`xyz`** contains **`"xyz"`**.
* So, the **content** of the two strings is **not the same**, and `.equals()` compares their content character-by-character.

---

# Doubts - ü§î But What About **References**?

If you wanted to compare whether **two references point to the same object** (memory location), you would use **`==`**.

```java
String abc = new String("abc");
String xyz = new String("xyz");

System.out.println(abc == xyz);  // This should return false
```

**Why does `abc == xyz` return** **false**?

* `==` checks **reference equality**, not content.
* Even though both `abc` and `xyz` contain `"abc"` and `"xyz"` respectively, **they are different objects in memory**.
* When you create two new `String` objects like `new String("abc")`, each `new String()` creates a **new object** in memory, even if the content is the same.

So, **`abc` and `xyz` are different objects in memory**, hence `==` returns **false**.

---

### Understanding **References** with an Example:

When you say **references are the same**, we mean **two variables point to the same memory location**. Here's a breakdown:

```java
String str1 = "java";    // Uses the String pool for memory optimization.
String str2 = "java";    // Points to the same "java" in the pool.

System.out.println(str1 == str2);    // This will return true (same reference)

String str3 = new String("java");  // This creates a new object in memory.
System.out.println(str1 == str3);    // This will return false (different reference)

System.out.println(str1.equals(str3));  // This will return true (same content)
```

### Key Points:

1. **`str1 == str2`** is **true** because both `str1` and `str2` refer to the same **memory location** in the **String pool**.
2. **`str1 == str3`** is **false** because `str3` is created using `new String("java")`, which creates a **new object in memory**, while `str1` points to the string pool.
3. **`str1.equals(str3)`** is **true** because `.equals()` compares **content**, and `"java" == "java"`, so it returns **true**.

---

### üß† **Reference vs Object Comparison**:

* **`==`** checks if **two references** point to the **same object** in memory.
* **`.equals()`** checks if **the objects' contents** are the same, even if they are at different memory locations.

---

### Your Doubt:

You wrote:

> *abc and xyz reference are same*
> *Can you explain me what is reference?*

Here‚Äôs the clarification:

* **No**, `abc` and `xyz` are not the **same reference**. They are **two different objects** in memory because you used the `new` keyword to create them. This makes `abc` and `xyz` point to **different memory locations**, even though their contents are different (i.e., `"abc"` vs `"xyz"`).

* A **reference** in Java is like a **pointer** that holds the memory address of an object. When two references point to the same object, they are considered **the same reference**. But when they point to **different objects** (even if the content inside those objects is the same), they are **different references**.

---

### Conclusion:

* **`==`** compares **references** (memory addresses).
* **`.equals()`** compares **contents** (object values or fields).

So in your case:

```java
String abc = new String("abc");
String xyz = new String("xyz");

abc.equals(xyz);  // false (because content is different)
```

Even though the two strings (`abc` and `xyz`) may **look similar** (because they hold string values), they are **two different objects in memory**. Thus, **`==` and `.equals()` behave differently based on what they are comparing**.

# My Explanation and understanding 


Example 1:
```java
String s1 = "java";
String s2 = "java";
```
Here 

1. 
```java
s1==s2 // this return true because "java" is created in String pool Note: please mention string pool is which part of memory ?
```


```java
2. s1.equalse(s2)
// this also return true because reference as well as contain both are same.
// and when the comparion is happen then override method of Sting is used and from
// the first check it self it return true because reference are equals 
//  No need to check obj instance of String and lenght and each char sequences.
```

Example 2 :
```java
String a1 = new String("abc");
String a2 = new String("abc");
```
Here 
```java
1. a1==a2 
// this return false because a1 and a2 are objects, and they are different object. when we create String with new key word. then it will create a 
// new object.
// AND a1 and a2 are not same reference they are different Object 
```

```java
2. a1.equals(a2) 
// This will return true because 
// 1. first it will check reference are equals or not via " if (this == obj) return true;  " this condition fail 
// 2. then it will check instanceof which will pass 
// 3. will check lengh that also pass 
// 4. will check each str charAt(i) will pass so this will return true. 
// 5. Final result will be true;
```


Example 3 : 

```java
String str1 = new String("java");
String str2 = "java";

```
```java
1. str1==str2 // return false because str1 is created via new key word so it is an Object and str2 (Object or what ?? I'm not sure pls explan this)
```
```java
2. str1.equals(str2) // return true but at what level ?? I guess reference is not same so second it will check instanceof ,
lenghth, the char sequences then it will return true.
```



Example :
```java
class Student {
  private String fname;
  private long roll_no;
  Student(String fname, long roll_no)
  {
    this.fname=fname;
    this.roll_no=roll_no;
  }
} 
```

**Here we can't create Object of Student without new keyword right ??**

Yes 



Example 4 :
```java
Student st1 = new Student("Tom",101);
Student st2 = new Student("Tom",101);
```
```java
1. st1 == st2 // false because both are created with new keyword so both are different object.
st1 and st2 two objects but i am confused here, here what is reference ??
```
```java
2. st1.equals(st2) // so here this will return false because it will use default equals()
method of Object class which first check reference like string equls method. and return the result coz there is no more check for instance and length and sequences etc.
```

If we override equals method in this class as :

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj instanceof Person other) {
         return this.fname.equals(other.fname) && this.roll_no == other.roll_no;
    }
    return false;
}
``` 

So now 

Example 5 :
```java
Student st1 = new Student("Tom",101);
Student st2 = new Student("Tom",101);
```

```java
1. st1 == st2 // false because both are created with new keyword so both are different object. st1 and st2 two objects but i am confused here, here what is reference ??
```

```java
2. st1.equals(st2) // true because we override equals method .
```

# Correction in my example :



### **Example 1: String Pool and `==` vs `.equals()`**

```java
String s1 = "java";
String s2 = "java";
```

1. **`s1 == s2`**
   ‚úÖ **True**. Both `s1` and `s2` point to the **same object in the string pool**.

   * **String pool** is a special area of memory that Java uses to store **unique string literals** (like `"java"`, `"hello"`, etc.).
   * The JVM reuses strings in the pool for **optimization**. So, when you assign `"java"` to `s1` and `s2`, both variables refer to the **same instance** in the **string pool**, hence the **same reference**.

   **Memory Area**: String pool is part of the **heap memory**, but it is a special area managed by the JVM to store string literals.

2. **`s1.equals(s2)`**
   ‚úÖ **True**. The `.equals()` method checks **content equality**.

   * Since both `s1` and `s2` refer to the same string, the content is the same (`"java"`), so `.equals()` returns `true`.



### **Example 2: Using `new` with Strings**

```java
String a1 = new String("abc");
String a2 = new String("abc");
```

1. **`a1 == a2`**
   ‚úÖ **False**.

   * When you use `new String("abc")`, Java creates a **new object** on the heap, even if the content (`"abc"`) is the same.
   * **`a1` and `a2` are two different objects**, so `==` checks for **reference equality** and returns `false` because they are **two different objects in memory**.

2. **`a1.equals(a2)`**
   ‚úÖ **True**.

   * The `.equals()` method checks the **contents** of the strings. Since `"abc"` equals `"abc"`, it returns **true**.
   * The `.equals()` method doesn't care about whether they are the **same reference**‚Äîit checks the **contents** instead.



### **Example 3: Mixing String Pool and `new`**

```java
String str1 = new String("java");
String str2 = "java";
```

1. **`str1 == str2`**
   ‚úÖ **False**.

   * `str1` is created using `new String("java")`, which means **it is a new object** in memory.
   * `str2` refers to the string **literal** `"java"` in the **string pool**. Since **`str1` and `str2` are different objects**, `==` will return **false**.

2. **`str1.equals(str2)`**
   ‚úÖ **True**.

   * The `.equals()` method compares the **contents** of the strings, and both `str1` and `str2` have the same content, `"java"`.
   * Even though they are **different objects** in memory, their content is the same, so `.equals()` will return **true**.



### **Example 4: Custom Class with `new` Keyword**

```java
class Student {
    private String fname;
    private long roll_no;

    Student(String fname, long roll_no) {
        this.fname = fname;
        this.roll_no = roll_no;
    }
}

Student st1 = new Student("Tom", 101);
Student st2 = new Student("Tom", 101);
```

1. **`st1 == st2`**
   ‚úÖ **False**.

   * Both `st1` and `st2` are created using the `new` keyword, which means they are **two different objects** in memory.
   * `==` compares references (memory locations), and since `st1` and `st2` point to **different objects**, it returns **false**.

2. **`st1.equals(st2)`**
   ‚úÖ **False** (by default).

   * Since we haven't overridden `.equals()` in the `Student` class, it will use the default `.equals()` method from the `Object` class.
   * The default `equals()` method compares **references** (just like `==`), so it will return **false** for `st1` and `st2` because they are different objects in memory.



### **Example 5: Overriding `equals()` in Custom Class**

Now, let's override the `.equals()` method:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true; // If the references are the same, return true.
    if (obj instanceof Student) {  // Check if the object is of type Student
        Student other = (Student) obj;
        return this.fname.equals(other.fname) && this.roll_no == other.roll_no; // Compare content
    }
    return false;  // Return false if it's not a Student object
}
```

Now, if we test this:

```java
Student st1 = new Student("Tom", 101);
Student st2 = new Student("Tom", 101);
```

1. **`st1 == st2`**
   ‚úÖ **False**.

   * They are still different objects created with `new`, so `==` checks for reference equality and returns **false** because they are **two different objects** in memory.

2. **`st1.equals(st2)`**
   ‚úÖ **True** (because of the overridden `equals()` method).

   * This time, the overridden `.equals()` method is used.
   * It first checks if the references are the same (`this == obj`). If they are not, it checks if the object is an instance of `Student`, then compares the **content**: the `fname` and `roll_no` fields.
   * Since both `st1` and `st2` have the same values for `fname` (`"Tom"`) and `roll_no` (`101`), it returns **true**.



### **Summary: What is a Reference?**

In all of these examples, the **reference** is simply a variable that holds the **memory address** of an object in memory.

* When we say **`st1 == st2` is `false`**, we mean **they are two different objects in memory**, so their references are different.
* When we say **`s1 == s2` is `true`**, we mean **they are referring to the same memory location** (in the case of the string pool).



### Final Clarifications:

* **String Pool**: This is a special part of the heap memory where string literals are stored. The JVM optimizes memory usage by reusing string literals.
* **`new` keyword**: When you use `new`, it creates **new objects in memory**, even if the content is the same. So, `new String("abc")` creates a new object in memory, while string literals refer to the same instance in the string pool.

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you'd like further explanations! üòä
